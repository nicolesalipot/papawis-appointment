# Sports Facility Appointment System – Detailed Development Plan

This document outlines a phased roadmap to build a comprehensive sports facility appointment system. Each module is divided into phases, and every phase lists granular tasks that can be turned into user-stories or tickets in your project management tool of choice.

**Frontend-First Approach**

Because the initial focus is on client-side development, all backend/API work is intentionally deferred to later quarters. During the frontend sprints, data will be served from mock services (e.g., JSON fixtures or Mock Service Worker). Backend-specific items are marked _(Back-End)_ and will be revisited once the UI/UX foundation is stable.

## Module 1: Core System & Facility Management

### Phase 1 – Admin Foundation

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Bootstrap the codebase (monorepo or separate front-/back-end repos).
   - Configure continuous integration (CI) pipeline (linting, tests, build).
   - Initialize environment configuration (dev, staging, prod `.env` conventions).
2. **Admin Authentication**
   - Design DB schema for `AdminUser` (email, hashed_password, role, status).
   - Implement secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt/argon2).
   - Create login & logout API endpoints (REST or GraphQL mutations).
   - Issue JWT/secure session cookies with refresh-token rotation.
   - Add “forgot password / reset password” flow.
   - Hard-code a super-admin seed migration for first-time access.
3. **Basic Dashboard UI Shell**
   - Set up React/Vue/Angular admin app with routing and protected route guard.
   - Build layout components: Side Navigation, Top Bar (logo, user menu), Main Content area.
   - Integrate a design system (e.g., TailwindCSS, MUI, Ant Design).
   - Implement responsive behaviour for desktop/tablet/mobile breakpoints.
   - Add placeholder pages for upcoming modules (Facilities, Users, Reports, Settings).

### Phase 2 – Facility CRUD Operations

1. **Database & API Layer**
   - Design `Facility` schema: id, name, type, capacity, location, description, operating_hours JSON, images (array of URLs/IDs), created_by, timestamps.
   - Create migration scripts & ORM model.
   - Scaffold CRUD endpoints (create, list w/ filters & pagination, detail, update, soft-delete/restore).
   - Add validation (duplicate name in same location, capacity > 0, hours format, etc.).
2. **Admin Facility Management UI**
   - Build facility list view with search, sort, and pagination.
   - Create facility detail & edit forms (multi-step or tabs for metadata, hours, images).
   - Implement image upload widget (drag-and-drop, preview, remove) backed by cloud storage (e.g., S3) and signed-URL flow.
   - Add inline validation & error handling.
   - Include audit trail panel (created_by, last_updated_by, change log placeholder).
3. **Testing & QA**
   - Unit tests for service layer & validators.
   - Integration tests for CRUD endpoints (happy & edge cases).
   - E2E tests for admin workflows (Cypress/Playwright).

## Module 2: User & Membership Management

### Phase 1 – User Roles & Permissions

1. **Role & Permission Design**
   - Define roles: SuperAdmin, FacilityManager, Member.
   - Create `Role` & `Permission` tables or enum mapping.
   - Implement RBAC middleware (server) and route guards (client).
2. **Admin-Side User Management UI**
   - User list with filters (role, status) and bulk actions (activate, deactivate).
   - User detail drawer/page showing profile, roles, recent activity.
   - Forms to create/edit users and assign facilities (for FacilityManager).
   - Password reset & temporary password generation.
3. **Invite / Activation Flow**
   - Generate invitation links with expiry.
   - Email templates for invite & activation confirmation.

### Phase 2 – Customer-Facing Portal

1. **Public Registration & Login**
   - Responsive sign-up/sign-in pages.
   - Email verification step (optional).
   - OAuth/Social logins (optional, stretch goal).
2. **Customer Profiles**
   - Profile page: personal info, change password, notification preferences.
   - Booking history table with filters (upcoming, past, cancelled).
3. **Membership Tiers (Optional)**
   - Design tier schema (name, price, booking window, discounts).
   - Integrate payment gateway (Stripe) for subscriptions.
   - Enforce tier rules in booking engine (earlier booking window for premium, etc.).

## Module 3: Booking & Scheduling Engine

### Phase 1 – Core Booking Logic (Admin-Focused)

1. **Availability Model**
   - Develop algorithm to generate available slots from operating_hours and existing bookings.
   - Respect custom closures/maintenance periods.
2. **Manual Booking Creation (Admin UI)**
   - Calendar view with day/week/month toggle.
   - Drag-and-drop or form-based booking creation for any user.
   - Conflict detection with real-time validation.
3. **Booking Rules Engine**
   - Prevent double-booking, enforce capacity limits.
   - Enforce advance booking/cancellation windows (configurable).
   - Hook for membership-based perks (priority windows, discounts).

### Phase 2 – Customer-Facing Booking & Notifications

1. **Public Booking Interface**
   - Facility selector → date picker → timeslot selector flow.
   - Display real-time availability (web-socket or polling).
2. **Time Slot Management**
   - Configurable slot length (e.g., 30/60 min) or custom start/end.
   - Buffer time before/after bookings (setup/cleanup time).
3. **Notifications System**
   - Integrate email/SMS provider.
   - Templates for confirmation, reminder (24h before), cancellation.
   - Background job scheduler for reminders.
4. **Cancellation / Rescheduling**
   - Self-service cancellation/reschedule respecting business rules.
   - Admin override ability.
   - Update availability instantly across all clients.

## Module 4: Reporting & Analytics

### Phase 1 – Basic Reporting

1. **Admin Dashboard Widgets**
   - Today’s bookings count & revenue (if paid).
   - Facility utilization percentage (today / last 7 days).
   - New users sign-ups today.
2. **Booking Reports Tool**
   - Date range picker, facility/user filters.
   - Export to CSV / Excel.
   - Save report presets.

### Phase 2 – Advanced Analytics

1. **Peak Hour Analysis**
   - Aggregate bookings by hour/day-of-week per facility.
   - Visualize heatmaps & line charts.
2. **User Activity Tracking**
   - Leaderboard of most active users.
   - Churn analysis (inactive for X days).
3. **Data Visualization Layer**
   - Integrate chart library (Chart.js, Recharts, or ECharts).
   - Build reusable `<ChartCard>` component for dashboards.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns & Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** HTTPS everywhere, OWASP best practices, rate limiting, audit logging.
- **Performance:** Lazy loading chunks, database indexing, caching of static data.
- **Accessibility (a11y):** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance on all customer-facing pages.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Prepare for multi-language support.
- **Testing Strategy:** Unit, integration, end-to-end, load testing for booking spikes.
- **DevOps:** Dockerized services, infrastructure as code (Terraform), automated deploys.
- **Monitoring:** Centralized logging, uptime alerts, error tracking (Sentry).
