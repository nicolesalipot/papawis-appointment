### Frontend-First Priorities (Complete These First)

1. **User Management Interface** - Core table with search and filtering
2. **User Creation & Editing** - Forms with role assignment
3. **Role-Based Access Control** - Route guards and conditional UI
4. **User Invitation System** - Complete invitation workflow
5. **User Detail Views** - Comprehensive user profiles

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Admin can view all users with advanced filtering and search
- [ ] Admin can create new users with role assignment
- [ ] Admin can edit user information and change roles
- [ ] Admin can invite users via email with role pre-assignment
- [ ] Different user roles see appropriate interface elements
- [ ] Facility managers can be assigned to specific facilities
- [ ] User activation flow works smoothly for invited users
- [ ] Bulk operations work efficiently for user management
- [ ] All forms have proper validation and error handling
- [ ] Interface is responsive and accessible

### How to Use

1. Focus on Frontend-First priorities for immediate development.
2. Mark items as completed (`[x]`) as they are finished.
3. Backend items (marked with _(Backend)_) remain unchecked until Q2.
4. Use this checklist to track sprint progress and plan iterations.
